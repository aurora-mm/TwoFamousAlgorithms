# Overview

This [R](https://www.r-project.org) package features implementations of [the Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm), which calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers, and [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), used for finding the shortest path in a graph. This package is a part of the coursework for the Advanced Programming in R course (732A94) at Linköping University.

# Dependencies

R (>= v3.5.0)

# Installation

To install this R package, you can utilize the `devtools` package, which facilitates the installation of packages hosted on GitHub repositories. First, ensure you have this package installed by executing `install.packages("devtools")`. Then, use the function `devtools::install_github("aurora-mm/TwoFamousAlgorithms")`. This command will clone the repository and install the package directly into your R environment, making it readily available for use.
