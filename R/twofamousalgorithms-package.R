#' twofamousalgorithms: Implementations of the Euclidean algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm
#'
#' This R package features implementations of the Euclidean algorithm, 
#' which calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers, and Dijkstra's 
#' algorithm, used for finding the shortest path in a graph. This package is a 
#' part of the coursework for the Advanced Programming in R course (732A94) at 
#' Link√∂ping University.
#' 
#' @section dijkstra:
#' The algorithm takes a graph and an initial node and calculates the shortest
#' path from the initial node to every other node in the graph.
#'
#' @section euclidean
#' The algorithm takes two numeric scalars and applies the Euclidean
#' algorithm to it. In the case these two numeric scalars are
#' integers the greatest common divisor is yielded.
