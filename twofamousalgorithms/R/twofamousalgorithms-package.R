#' twofamousalgorithms: Implementations of the Euclidean algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm
#'
#' This package includes implementations of two famous algorithms: the Euclidean algorithm 
#' for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers and Dijkstra algorithm for finding 
#' the shortest path in a graph.
#' 
#' @section dijkstra:
#' The algorithm takes a graph and an initial node and calculates the shortest
#' path from the initial node to every other node in the graph.
#'
#' @section euclidean:
#' Takes two numeric scalars and applies the euclidean algorithm to them. In the case
#' of two integers the greatest common divisor is yielded.
